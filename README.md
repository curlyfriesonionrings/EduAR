# EduAR
A demo of the proof-of-concept for this tool can be found here: https://youtu.be/uM3IxKYQ1WE

This project was developed in Unity with many assets, so the project has not been comitted to the repository.

EduAR was meant to be a companion tool for physical educational material. Physical media (such as books) have low interactivity and can be outdated in information. EduAR is an application that is installed on a mobile device that uses augmented reality (AR) to provide a learner with digital engagement of the topic.

The application was built using the Unity engine, paired with the Vuforia AR library.
